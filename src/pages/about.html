    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>
        This site allows searching for flights on many dates to many destinations simultaniously. This is often the
        search I want to do for myself but I can't find a site to do it this way.
    </p>

    <p> Sometimes, I know the destination, and more or less the dates. In this situation, I am happy with the well
        known flight tickets
        sites.
        Very often, I
        just want to go somewhere when I will have time, and I am open for sugestions from Oslo to Barcelona. I
        base my choice on flight times, destination and price. I aim to make this search possible in a single page,
        just filtering the availbale flights and never having to ask for data to reload to match my changed search
        criteria. And I could leave Friday evening or Saturday morning, or a week later if necessary, and want that
        as
        one search criteria, not as
        two separate searches.

    <h3>Q&A</h3>

    <p class="question"><b class="qa">Q:&nbsp</b>Where does the flight data come from</p>

    <p class="answer"><b class="qa">A:&nbsp</b>At the moment, the site shows only transavia flights, with data
        provided by Transavia. Flight
        information is updated once daily, so there is a small chance that a flight you see here is not available
        to book.
        The site will be extended to show data about other flights provided by
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/qpx-express/?hl=en">Google QPX Express API</a></p>
